# Description  

TaskList is a simple to-do list app, with basic customizable features. Users can create lists, add tasks and undo tasks. List names and tasks can be edited by the user. Lists are created with an incomplete tag. After checking off all the tasks in the list, the incomplete tag will switch to the complete task. Undoing a task in a completed lists also changes the completion status.

## Modules

I will be using passport to handle user authorization and registration, along with the passport-local-mongoose plug-in for mongoose for saving and updating the database. 

Using dotenv for loading environment variables
